### About This Project

Image Recognition 5 Days Bootcamp is a hands-on, project-based journey into modern computer vision. Built and tested entirely in Google Colab, this bootcamp covers:

- **Day 1:** Dataset download, MNIST & CIFAR-10 exploration, preprocessing, and visualization  
- **Day 2:** Building and training a CNN from scratch (TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **Day 3:** Data augmentation, batch normalization, and advanced model training  
- **Day 4:** Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 on Cats vs. Dogs dataset (Kaggle)  
- **Day 5 (suggested):** Model evaluation, ROC/AUC, deployment tips  

---

### Why This Project?

- **End-to-End Workflow:** From data prep to model evaluation, this repo demonstrates a real-world ML pipeline.
- **Industry-Ready Practices:** Includes transfer learning, data augmentation, and efficient model evaluation.
- **Recruiter Value:** Shows experience with TensorFlow, Keras, Colab, Kaggle, GitHub, and modern ML best practices.
- **Portfolio Showcase:** Each notebook cell is annotated for clarity and reproducibility.
